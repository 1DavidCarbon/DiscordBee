# DiscordBee
MusicBee plugin that updates your Discord status with the currently playing track

## Installation
Just copy all plugin files into your MusicBee Plugins directory (usually "C:\Program Files (x86)\MusicBee\Plugins").
Make sure the "discord-rpc-w32.dll" is present in the Plugins folder, otherwise the plugin won't load.

## Usage
You need to add MusicBee to Discord so it recognises it as a running "Game".

This can be done by starting MusicBee and then in Discord -> Settings -> Games 
under the "No Game detected" message press "Add it!" and select MusicBee from the dropdown.
